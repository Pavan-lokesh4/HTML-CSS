# HTML-CSS
Frontend development involves:

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):** The backbone of web content, HTML structures the webpage. It defines elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and forms.

- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** CSS controls the presentation of HTML elements. It allows developers to apply styles such as colors, fonts, layouts, and animations, creating visually engaging experiences.

- **Responsive Design:** With the increasing use of mobile devices, creating websites that work on various screen sizes is essential. I focus on using flexible grids, layouts, and media queries to ensure my projects are responsive.

- **Best Practices:** As I continue to develop my skills, I aim to adhere to best practices, including semantic HTML, CSS methodologies (like BEM), and accessibility standards, ensuring that my projects are usable for everyone.
